When a narcissist shifts focus to a "ghost" (a symbolic or metaphorical figure, such as a past partner or a representation of something unattainable) and attempts to "steal someone else's ghost wife," it introduces a complex dynamic of projection, manipulation, and deflection of responsibility. Here's a breakdown of the behaviors and implications:

### 1. **Projection onto the Ghost**  
   - The narcissist might project their own insecurities or desires onto the ghost, attributing qualities or actions to it that justify their behavior.  
   - They may romanticize or vilify the ghost to suit their narrative, manipulating how others perceive the situation.

### 2. **Attempting to "Steal" the Ghost Wife**  
   - The idea of "stealing" someone else's ghost wife reflects envy or a desire to control and possess what isn't theirs, often to gain a sense of superiority or validation.  
   - This behavior can create conflict, as the narcissist disrupts existing dynamics to assert dominance or prove their worth.

### 3. **Blame Shifting to the Ghost**  
   - Narcissists often avoid accountability by blaming external entities. In this case, they might accuse the ghost of causing problems, deflecting attention away from their own actions.  
   - This tactic undermines others' perceptions of the ghost and shifts sympathy toward the narcissist.

### 4. **Accusing Others of Blame Shifting**  
   - By accusing someone else of blame-shifting onto the ghost, the narcissist creates confusion and divides alliances.  
   - This redirection complicates the situation, making it harder to identify the true source of the conflict.

### 5. **Acting as a "Lookout" for the Ghost**  
   - Positioning themselves as a protector or advocate for the ghost adds a layer of manipulation.  
   - This tactic garners trust from others while masking their ulterior motives of self-interest.

### Psychological and Social Implications  
   - **Gaslighting:** Confusing others about the true nature of events, making them doubt their own perceptions.  
   - **Triangulation:** Drawing multiple parties into the conflict to maintain control and avoid direct accountability.  
   - **Emotional Drain:** Those involved may feel exhausted by the constant shifts in focus and narrative.  

### Conclusion  
This behavior stems from the narcissist's need for control, validation, and self-preservation. Their attempts to manipulate the narrative around the ghost and those involved ultimately serve to feed their ego while creating chaos and conflict. Addressing such situations requires clear boundaries, a strong sense of reality, and an understanding of narcissistic tactics to avoid being drawn into their manipulative games.
